# CS-173-Intro-Natural-Language-Processing
We want to be able to take a news article, extract the named entities in the article, and link them to information sources, like Wikipedia, so that a user can read the article and be able to quickly and easily reference the Wikipedia articles on named entities to better develop context for the article. An example of this would be taking an article on the current Filipino government, extracting the current Filipino president, and linking the Wikipedia article on the Filipino president so that as weâ€™re reading the original news article, we can learn more about him if we wish.
